/**
 * Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
 * bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?
 * 1)to test it we need to create matrix our matrix or just use some image.
 * 2)method which takes matrix as input (todo search for some additional library)
 * 3)do the rotation of matrix (matrix 3x3 -(initial 1x3 value saved in x) -> 1x1 going to 1x3 index -> 1x3 moves to 1x1 index
 * -> and so on for 1x,2x,3x .....(that mean we can do it in place with one initial array and additional primitive variable)
